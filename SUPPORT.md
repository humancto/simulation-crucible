# Support

## Where to Ask for Help

- Usage questions and setup help: open a GitHub Discussion or issue in this repository.
- Bug reports: use the Bug Report issue template.
- New simulation ideas: use the Simulation Proposal template.
- Security concerns: follow `SECURITY.md` and report privately.

## What to Include

Please include enough detail so someone else can reproduce your situation:

- OS and Python version
- command you ran
- exact error output
- simulation id, variant, and seed (if relevant)
- whether this worked on a previous commit

## Response Expectations

This project is community-maintained. Maintainers will triage when available, prioritize correctness and reproducibility issues first, and may ask for a minimal reproduction before investigating deeper.
